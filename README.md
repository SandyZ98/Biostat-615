2023 Fall Biostat 615 - Group6 

**Goal**
  - To use time series data of CO2 to calculate room ventilation rate. Our methodology will follow closely the “Build-Up Method” from [10] which implements dampened Newton-Raphson algorithm to solve for the Air Exchange rate. From this air exchange rate, we can solve for the room ventilation rate.
